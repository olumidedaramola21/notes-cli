This project is a Node.js command-line application for managing notes. It provides various commands to create, retrieve, find, and delete notes. Additionally, it includes a web server to display notes in a web browser. The notes are stored in a JSON file (`db.json`), and the application uses the `yargs` library to handle command-line arguments and commands.

Key functionalities include:

- Creating new notes with optional tags.
- Retrieving all notes.
- Finding notes based on a filter applied to the note content.
- Removing notes by ID.
- Removing all notes.
- Launching a web server to view notes in a browser.

The project structure includes source files for commands, database operations, note management, and a web server, as well as test files for unit testing the note functionalities.
